## Main ideas:
- picking the best method(s) for migrating existing users into Auth0 is all about understanding the supported options and their tradeoffs:
    - Automatic or 'lazy'
    - Bulk
- not all options are mutually exclusive (hybrid)
- configuring Auth0 to act as a proxy front end to an existing authentication system or data-store is another powerful option

## Asset ideas:
- Decision graph (when to use each method?)
- Data Flow Diagram (DFD - C4 level 4): lazy load
- C4 diagrams (level 3 & level 4): proxy front end
